**NASA Space Apps 2024 Seismic Cahellenge**

Let the fun begin 🚀

## Glossary

To keep things tidy we've organized our applications in several modules and gave them appropirate acronyhms:

- RESONATE - Remote Exploration for Seismic Oscillations and Novel Analysis of Tectonic Events

  Our project, team and repository name

- SCAMP (Seismic Computer Analysis Program)

  Web Application to display dashboard of seismic data filtering

- SMART (Seismic Model Analysis and Recognition Tool)
  Seismic data filtering algorithm, intended to feed data into ML model.
  
- SCALE (Seismic Classification and Learning Engine)
  Machine Learning model to detect seismic events.
  
- EMAIL model (Electronic Machine Artificial Intelligence Learning)
  Seismic detection machine algorithm, that don’t utilize ML
  
- CRISP (Cheap Raspberry Instrument for Seismic Processing)
  Raspberry Pi sensor with detection algorithm.


- KFTSD (Kalman filtering Based Thresholding for Seismic Detection)

  Kalman filter based frequency domain smoothing with thresholding for Seismic Detection on Moon and Mars
For reader’s convenience we’ve given each part a distinct name:

    RESONATE (Remote Exploration for Seismic Oscillations and Novel Analysis of Tectonic Events)Our project, team and repository name.
    SCAMP (Seismic Computer Analysis Program)Web Application to display a dashboard of seismic data filtering.
